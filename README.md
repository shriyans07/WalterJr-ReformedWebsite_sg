# WalterJr-ReformedWebsite_sg
I re-designed Walter Jr's website from Breaking Bad, that collected donations in order to fund his father's cancer treatment. The website I made is more organized and easier to read, though Walter Jr's website comes from the heart and is very wholesome.

In this website, I made three pages: Walter White's professions and kindness; Lung Cancer description; Family Biography
In the header of each page, I have a dislcaimer stating that this is based on a fictional website, and thus, you can not actually donate any money.
The header title becomes less opaque when you hover over it, so you can the banner image of Walter White's face more clearly.
At the bottom of each page, I have a donate button, but when you click on it, it forwards the user to amc.com, where they can watch shows such as Breaking Bad.
Lastly, check out the recording of the website, that shows a sneak peak into the user interface of the website.
