                    <p class="p">My father is the most knowledgable person in Chemistry I have ever seen. He is extremely overqualified as just a regular high school Chemistry teacher. Sometimes, dad tells me about how he had started a Chemical Research company, called Gray Matter, in graduate school, but his evil partners had pushed him out of the company. Since then, the company is worth billions of dollars, while my father only received $5,000 for his shares and now has a low salary teaching ungrateful students, who don't pay attention to his wisdom. He contributed a great amount to the Chemistry world, but he never received the rewards of his work.</p>

                    <p class="p">Along with being a teacher, my father used to have a part-time job at a car wash. He had a rude manager, who had very thick eyebrows. Some students found my dad working at the car wash and cleaning their car, so they took a picture of him and spread it around the school, which greatly embarrassed my father. Eventually, as my father's condition worsened, he had no choice but to quit this job. Now, he can no longer keep up with the high costs of his treatment.</p>

                    <p class="p">Recently, my father taught me how to drive, and I got my drivers licence. Then, for my sixteenth birthday, my dad bought me my dream car. My mother wanted me to have an old run-down car, but my father is cooler, and got me the Dodge. With this car, I can drive really fast and do donuts. Also I can rev it up, and it sounds like I'm driving a race car.</p>

                    <p class="p">One of my biggest hobbies is eating breakfast. My dad and mom make it possible for me to have eggs, bacon, and orange juice every day. He just makes it so yummy! Recently, despite his current condition, he still cooks me breakfast sometimes, which shows how much he cares for me.</p>
