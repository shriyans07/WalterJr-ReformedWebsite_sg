                    <p class="p">My name is Walter White Jr. I have cerebral palsy, so I have trouble with my speech and impaired motor control. However, I don't let that get in my way, as I still enjoy hanging out with my friends, driving my sports car, and eating breakfast.</p>

                   <p class="p">My father's name is Walter White, and he is a high school Chemistry teacher. He went to the California Institute of Technology and is extremely smart. During his time in graduate school, he co-founded a research company, from which he only got $5,000 after he sold his shares. Now he is an overqualified Chemistry teacher, but unfortunately, he recently got Lung Cancer.</p>

                    <p class="p">My mother's name is Skyler White. Though she cooks really tasty breakfasts for me, she sometimes loses her temper. However, she is still very kind and compassionate toward us. She works as hard as she can to help our family pay for my father's cancer treatment, but unfortunately, it's not enough.</p>

                    <p class="p">We all love each other in our family, and we really do not want to lose any of our family members. That's why we are asking, out of the kindness of your heart, that you please donate to my father's cancer treatment. Anything is appreciated!</p>
