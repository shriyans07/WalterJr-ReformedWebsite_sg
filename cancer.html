                    <p class="p">Shortly after his 50th birthday, my father received the tragic news that he had lung cancer. In lung cancer, the cancer cells block the major airways in the lungs which causes shortness of breath. Lung Cancer also causes fluid to build up in the lungs, making it harder for the lungs to expand, leading to the patient coughing up blood. My father was already working two jobs just to pay for the mortgage of our house, so this major inconvenience forced him to quit his job at the car wash and take time off of teaching. Now, there is surgery that my father must uptake to limit the spread of his lung cancer. Unfortunately, we do not have the money to pay for this life-saving surgery, so I am asking you, from the bottom of my heart to please spare a few dollars to donate to my dad's cancer treatment. Anything is appreciated!</p>
